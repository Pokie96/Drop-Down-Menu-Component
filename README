Contains a class for creating drop down menu items. 

This class does not create any new elements, instead it works using pre-existing elements in the html document.

The class contructor accepts three parameters: 
-The first parameter is the container that holds the drop down menu elements together
-The second parameter is for the title of the drop down menu (what is shown on the page before the drop-down is activated)
-The third paramater is the elements that are inside of the drop down when the drop down menu is activated.
